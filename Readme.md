# Barotrauma Save Editor (Work in Progress!)

## Current State
* [ ] Parse the Character.xml
* [ ] Collect all the necessary content data from the game folder
* [ ] Correctly export Character.xml
* [ ] Decompress .save
* [ ] Parse gamesession.xml
* [ ] Edit gamesession.xml Data
* [ ] Compress .save

## Why do I need a Barotrauma installation?
Most contents needed for parsing and changing saved games are "only" .xmls, but were purposefully left out of the [Barotrauma Github project](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma).
Just to be safe, I've decided to not include any content from the game and require an installation on the same machine that this application will run on.
